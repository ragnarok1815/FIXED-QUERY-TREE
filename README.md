Introduction:
         This project implements a Fixed Query Tree (FQT) data structure in C++.The FQT is a tree-based data structure used for efficient range query and nearest neighbor search operations on multidimensional data.
Features:
    Efficient storage and retrieval of data objects based on their spatial proximity within a fixed radius.
    Supports adding data objects to the FQT.
    Provides search functionality to retrieve data objects within a given range from a query point.
    Finds the nearest neighbor of a query point.
